Hello, my name is Braden Fowler. I am a college freshman at the University of Arkansas pursuing a degree in Data Science. I was born and raised in Springdale, Arkansas, a city just 15 minutes north of Fayetteville. I have a burning passion for music and find it to be my biggest hobby. I also love sports such as football and basketball. I spend a lot of my time doing schoolwork, delivering pizzas as my job, and playing/creating music. The reason I chose data science is because I have always been interested in statistics and innovation, and I believe in the future this career will be even more important than it is now. This is why I am pursuing a Bachelors degree in Data Science.
